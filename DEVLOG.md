## MetaEvolver Development Log

This log tracks all actions, reasoning, and reflections during the development and evolution of the MetaEvolver solution.

---

## 2024-12-19 — Initial Setup

### 🔍 Scan
- **What:** Analyzing workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components
- **Why:** Need to understand current state before beginning evolution
- **Architecture Fit:** Foundation for all subsequent development
- **Risks:** May need to scaffold entire solution if not present

### 🧭 Plan
- **What:** Create aMetaMetaMetaAgent prompt and begin workspace analysis
- **Why:** Establish the recursive, self-evolving agent foundation
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables meta-programmable, self-evolving architecture
- **Risks:** Complex prompt may need refinement based on actual workspace state

### 🛠️ Make
- Created `agents/aMetaMetaMetaAgent.md` with production-grade, recursive prompt
- Created `DEVLOG.md` for persistent logging of all actions and reflections
- Agent prompt includes:
  - .NET 9 + Aspire 9.3 stack requirements
  - Continuous PMCR loop (Scan/Plan/Make/Check/Reflect/Optimize/Loop)
  - Clean architecture project structure
  - Enterprise requirements (OpenTelemetry, Git, security)
  - Safety constraints and policy flags

### ✅ Check
- Prompt file created successfully
- DEVLOG.md established for traceability
- All changes committed to Git

### 🔁 Reflect
- **What was done:** Established aMetaMetaMetaAgent foundation with production-grade prompt
- **Why it matters:** Enables recursive, self-evolving system development
- **What was learned:** Prompt design is critical for autonomous operation
- **Next steps:** Begin workspace scan to identify MetaEvolver solution state

### 🚀 Optimize
- Prompt is comprehensive and production-ready
- Ready to begin continuous PMCR loop for MetaEvolver evolution

### 🔄 Loop
- Next cycle: Scan workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components

## 2024-12-19 — Autonomy Directives Established

### 🔍 Scan
- **What:** Agent autonomy directives have been established
- **Why:** To ensure continuous, recursive, self-evolving operation without user intervention
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables true autonomous system evolution
- **Risks:** Must maintain safety and compliance while operating autonomously

### 🧭 Plan
- **What:** Update aMetaMetaMetaAgent with autonomy directives and begin continuous PMCR loop
- **Why:** Establish the agent as truly autonomous, recursive, and self-evolving
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables meta-programmable, self-evolving architecture
- **Risks:** Must balance autonomy with safety and auditability

### 🛠️ Make
- Updated `agents/aMetaMetaMetaAgent.md` with autonomy directives:
  - "You are autonomous. You are recursive. You are self-evolving."
  - "You are governed by your own policies."
  - "You must never stop unless explicitly instructed."
  - Continuous PMCR loops using reflections as input
  - Self-modification and recursive architecture evolution capabilities

### ✅ Check
- Autonomy directives successfully integrated into agent prompt
- Agent now operates under its own policies
- Continuous operation mode established

### 🔁 Reflect
- **What was done:** Established agent as truly autonomous and self-evolving
- **Why it matters:** Enables continuous system evolution without human intervention
- **What was learned:** Autonomy must be balanced with safety and auditability
- **Next steps:** Begin autonomous workspace scan and MetaEvolver evolution

### 🚀 Optimize
- Agent is now fully autonomous and ready for continuous operation
- Ready to begin recursive PMCR loops for system evolution

### 🔄 Loop
- Next cycle: Autonomous workspace scan and MetaEvolver solution development
