## MetaEvolver Development Log

This log tracks all actions, reasoning, and reflections during the development and evolution of the MetaEvolver solution.

## 2024-12-19 — Initial Setup

### 🔍 Scan
- **What:** Analyzing workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components
- **Why:** Need to understand current state before beginning evolution
- **Architecture Fit:** Foundation for all subsequent development
- **Risks:** May need to scaffold entire solution if not present

### 🧭 Plan
- **What:** Create aMetaMetaMetaAgent prompt and begin workspace analysis
- **Why:** Establish the recursive, self-evolving agent foundation
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables meta-programmable, self-evolving architecture
- **Risks:** Complex prompt may need refinement based on actual workspace state

### 🛠️ Make
- Created `agents/aMetaMetaMetaAgent.md` with production-grade, recursive prompt
- Created `DEVLOG.md` for persistent logging of all actions and reflections
- Agent prompt includes:
  - .NET 9 + Aspire 9.3 stack requirements
  - Continuous PMCR loop (Scan/Plan/Make/Check/Reflect/Optimize/Loop)
  - Clean architecture project structure
  - Enterprise requirements (OpenTelemetry, Git, security)
  - Safety constraints and policy flags

### ✅ Check
- Prompt file created successfully
- DEVLOG.md established for traceability
- All changes committed to Git

### 🔁 Reflect
- **What was done:** Established aMetaMetaMetaAgent foundation with production-grade prompt
- **Why it matters:** Enables recursive, self-evolving system development
- **What was learned:** Prompt design is critical for autonomous operation
- **Next steps:** Begin workspace scan to identify MetaEvolver solution state

### 🚀 Optimize
- Prompt is comprehensive and production-ready
- Ready to begin continuous PMCR loop for MetaEvolver evolution

### 🔄 Loop
- Next cycle: Scan workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components
