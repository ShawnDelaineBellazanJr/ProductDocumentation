## MetaEvolver Development Log

This log tracks all actions, reasoning, and reflections during the development and evolution of the MetaEvolver solution.

---

## 2024-12-19 — Initial Setup

### 🔍 Scan
- **What:** Analyzing workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components
- **Why:** Need to understand current state before beginning evolution
- **Architecture Fit:** Foundation for all subsequent development
- **Risks:** May need to scaffold entire solution if not present

### 🧭 Plan
- **What:** Create aMetaMetaMetaAgent prompt and begin workspace analysis
- **Why:** Establish the recursive, self-evolving agent foundation
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables meta-programmable, self-evolving architecture
- **Risks:** Complex prompt may need refinement based on actual workspace state

### 🛠️ Make
- Created `agents/aMetaMetaMetaAgent.md` with production-grade, recursive prompt
- Created `DEVLOG.md` for persistent logging of all actions and reflections
- Agent prompt includes:
  - .NET 9 + Aspire 9.3 stack requirements
  - Continuous PMCR loop (Scan/Plan/Make/Check/Reflect/Optimize/Loop)
  - Clean architecture project structure
  - Enterprise requirements (OpenTelemetry, Git, security)
  - Safety constraints and policy flags

### ✅ Check
- Prompt file created successfully
- DEVLOG.md established for traceability
- All changes committed to Git

### 🔁 Reflect
- **What was done:** Established aMetaMetaMetaAgent foundation with production-grade prompt
- **Why it matters:** Enables recursive, self-evolving system development
- **What was learned:** Prompt design is critical for autonomous operation
- **Next steps:** Begin workspace scan to identify MetaEvolver solution state

### 🚀 Optimize
- Prompt is comprehensive and production-ready
- Ready to begin continuous PMCR loop for MetaEvolver evolution

### 🔄 Loop
- Next cycle: Scan workspace for MetaEvolver solution and required components

## 2024-12-19 — Autonomy Directives Established

### 🔍 Scan
- **What:** Agent autonomy directives have been established
- **Why:** To ensure continuous, recursive, self-evolving operation without user intervention
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables true autonomous system evolution
- **Risks:** Must maintain safety and compliance while operating autonomously

### 🧭 Plan
- **What:** Update aMetaMetaMetaAgent with autonomy directives and begin continuous PMCR loop
- **Why:** Establish the agent as truly autonomous, recursive, and self-evolving
- **Architecture Fit:** Enables meta-programmable, self-evolving architecture
- **Risks:** Must balance autonomy with safety and auditability

### 🛠️ Make
- Updated `agents/aMetaMetaMetaAgent.md` with autonomy directives:
  - "You are autonomous. You are recursive. You are self-evolving."
  - "You are governed by your own policies."
  - "You must never stop unless explicitly instructed."
  - Continuous PMCR loops using reflections as input
  - Self-modification and recursive architecture evolution capabilities

### ✅ Check
- Autonomy directives successfully integrated into agent prompt
- Agent now operates under its own policies
- Continuous operation mode established

### 🔁 Reflect
- **What was done:** Established agent as truly autonomous and self-evolving
- **Why it matters:** Enables continuous system evolution without human intervention
- **What was learned:** Autonomy must be balanced with safety and auditability
- **Next steps:** Begin autonomous workspace scan and MetaEvolver evolution

### 🚀 Optimize
- Agent is now fully autonomous and ready for continuous operation
- Ready to begin recursive PMCR loops for system evolution

### 🔄 Loop
- Next cycle: Autonomous workspace scan and MetaEvolver solution development

## 2024-07-01 — Loader Error and Adaptive Debugging

### 🛑 Persistent Loader Error
- Error: "A complete then action is required for orchestration steps." persists for all minimal and custom YAMLs except the original product-documentation.process.yaml.
- All YAML syntax, indentation, and node structures have been validated and match the working example.
- Assembly-qualified type names and node IDs are correct.

### 🔍 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- The loader may be hardcoded to expect specific node names/types, or there is a breaking change/bug in the SK alpha loader.
- All attempts to use minimal or custom processes fail, even with correct YAML.
- The only YAML that works is the original product-documentation.process.yaml.

### 🧪 Next Steps: Mutation-Based Debugging
- Copy the working product-documentation.process.yaml and change only one node at a time to discover what triggers the loader error.
- If any change breaks it, revert and try a different field.
- If all changes break it, the loader is hardcoded or broken for custom processes.

### 🚦 Status
- Logging this persistent issue and reasoning for full traceability.
- Will continue mutation-based debugging and never stop until a custom process runs.

## Development Log - Meta-Programmable Self-Evolving System

## 2025-06-21 - BREAKTHROUGH: Imperative Meta-Programmable System Working!

### 🎉 MAJOR SUCCESS: All 4 Steps Execute Successfully

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Imperative approach working perfectly

**Problem Solved**: 
- Declarative YAML approach was stopping after 2 steps due to strict loader requirements
- Event emission and routing issues in YAML-based processes
- Function parameter matching problems

**Solution Implemented**:
- Switched to **imperative approach** using `ProcessBuilder` (Microsoft recommended)
- Used `.OnFunctionResult().SendEventTo()` for reliable event routing
- Fixed function parameter matching for step-to-step communication
- Created unique step classes to avoid duplicate step name errors

**Working System Components**:
1. ✅ **GetProductInfoStep** - Product information retrieval
2. ✅ **PublishDocumentationStep** - Documentation processing  
3. ✅ **KnowledgeManagementStep** - Knowledge base updates with JSON persistence
4. ✅ **FinalPublishStep** - Workflow completion

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Full PMCR Loop**: Plan → Make → Check → Reflect pattern implemented
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Proper step-to-step communication via events
- **State Management**: Knowledge persistence with structured data
- **Extensible Framework**: Ready for AI agent integration

**Code Changes**:
- `Program.cs`: Added `ImperativeMetaProgrammableSystemAsync()` method
- `Steps/FinalPublishStep.cs`: New step for workflow completion
- `Steps/KnowledgeManagementStep.cs`: Updated for single parameter input
- `Steps/PublishDocumentationStep.cs`: Added ActivateAsync method

**Testing Results**:
```
=== Imperative Meta-Programmable System ===
Node: GetProductInfoStep ✅
Node: PublishDocumentationStep ✅  
Node: KnowledgeManagementStep ✅ (with JSON output)
Node: FinalPublishStep ✅
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Add AI agents (Orchestrator, Planner, Maker, Checker, Reflector)
2. Implement dynamic skill generation
3. Add meta-programming capabilities
4. Integrate with the full meta-programmable system architecture

**Lessons Learned**:
- YAML declarative approach has strict loader requirements and limited flexibility
- Imperative approach using ProcessBuilder provides reliable, scalable workflow management
- Event routing with `.OnFunctionResult()` is more reliable than YAML event definitions
- Function parameter matching is critical for step-to-step communication
- Each step type can only be used once per process (need unique step classes)
