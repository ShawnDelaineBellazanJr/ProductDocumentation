## PMCR Loop 1 â€” Bootstrapping MetaMetaMetaAgent

### What Worked
- Successfully created a versioned, auditable prompt for the MetaMetaMetaAgent.
- Registered the agent in the process YAML, ensuring it runs at workflow start.
- Added documentation and a stub for chunking/summarization logic.
- All changes are tracked in git and documented for traceability.

### What Could Be Improved
- Implement actual chunking and summarization logic in the stub.
- Add automated tests for the new agent and chunking logic.
- Expand the agent's capabilities to support prompt self-modification and versioning.
- Integrate feedback and reflection cycles into the agent's operation.

### Next Steps
- Implement chunking/summarization logic.
- Add tests and validation for agent-driven changes.
- Enable the agent to propose and apply improvements to its own prompt and architecture.
