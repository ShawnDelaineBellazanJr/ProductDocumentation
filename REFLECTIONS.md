## PMCR Loop 1 — Bootstrapping MetaMetaMetaAgent

### What Worked
- Successfully created a versioned, auditable prompt for the MetaMetaMetaAgent.
- Registered the agent in the process YAML, ensuring it runs at workflow start.
- Added documentation and a stub for chunking/summarization logic.
- All changes are tracked in git and documented for traceability.

### What Could Be Improved
- Implement actual chunking and summarization logic in the stub.
- Add automated tests for the new agent and chunking logic.
- Expand the agent's capabilities to support prompt self-modification and versioning.
- Integrate feedback and reflection cycles into the agent's operation.

### Next Steps
- Implement chunking/summarization logic.
- Add tests and validation for agent-driven changes.
- Enable the agent to propose and apply improvements to its own prompt and architecture.

## PMCR Loop 2 — Implementing Chain-of-Thought Logging

### What Worked
- Added a utility class for chain-of-thought logging (`Utils/ChainOfThoughtLogger.cs`).
- Integrated logging into a PlannerAgent stub to demonstrate PMCR phase logging.
- Excluded logs from version control via .gitignore.
- All actions were performed autonomously, without user confirmation, as per the new loop control rules.

### What Could Be Improved
- Integrate logging into all agent stubs and real agents.
- Summarize and visualize logs for easier review.
- Automate daily log summarization using ReflectorAgent.

### Next Steps
- Expand logging to all agents.
- Implement log summarization and visualization.
- Continue recursive PMCR loops for further improvements.
