# Meta-Programmable Self-Evolving System: Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the **Meta-Programmable Self-Evolving System** using Microsoft Semantic Kernel and the .NET 9 process framework. The system implements the full **PMCR (Plan-Make-Check-Reflect) loop** with the **Strange Loop principle** for continuous self-improvement.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of **five specialized AI agents** that work together in a coordinated workflow:

1. **OrchestratorAgent** - Main coordinator and decision maker
2. **PlannerAgent** - Strategic planning and task decomposition  
3. **MakerAgent** - Task execution and skill generation
4. **CheckerAgent** - Quality assurance and validation
5. **ReflectorAgent** - Learning and continuous improvement

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **KnowledgeManagementStep** - Persists learnings and insights
- **AuditLoggingStep** - Maintains audit trails and compliance
- **Prompty Templates** - Declarative behavior definition

## 🔄 The PMCR Loop Implementation

### 1. Plan Phase (Orchestrator → Planner)

```csharp
// Orchestrator analyzes goal and decides approach
orchestratorStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(plannerStep));

// Planner creates detailed execution plan
plannerStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(makerStep));
```

**What happens:**
- OrchestratorAgent receives the goal and analyzes complexity
- Determines if planning is needed or direct execution is possible
- PlannerAgent breaks down complex goals into actionable tasks
- Creates structured execution plans with success criteria

### 2. Make Phase (Maker)

```csharp
// Maker executes the plan and generates new capabilities
makerStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(checkerStep));
```

**What happens:**
- MakerAgent implements planned tasks using available skills
- **Generates new code/skills on-the-fly** when needed using Roslyn
- Creates new APIs using NSwag and OpenAPI
- Handles errors and retry logic
- Reports execution metrics and generated artifacts

### 3. Check Phase (Checker)

```csharp
// Checker validates results and ensures quality
checkerStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(reflectorStep));
```

**What happens:**
- CheckerAgent validates execution outcomes against success criteria
- Performs quality assessment and security review
- Identifies issues and recommends improvements
- Ensures compliance with policies and standards

### 4. Reflect Phase (Reflector → Knowledge → Audit)

```csharp
// Reflector learns and improves the system
reflectorStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(knowledgeManagementStep));

// Knowledge management persists learnings
knowledgeManagementStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .SendEventTo(new ProcessFunctionTargetBuilder(auditLoggingStep));

// Audit logging completes the cycle
auditLoggingStep
    .OnFunctionResult()
    .StopProcess();
```

**What happens:**
- ReflectorAgent analyzes the entire process and outcomes
- Extracts lessons learned and improvement opportunities
- **Updates system behavior** through prompt modifications
- KnowledgeManagementStep persists insights for future use
- AuditLoggingStep maintains complete traceability

## 🔧 Customization and Extension

### Adding New Agents

1. **Create Agent Step:**
   ```csharp
   public sealed class CustomAgentStep : KernelProcessStep
   {
       [KernelFunction]
       public async Task<string> CustomFunctionAsync(Kernel kernel, string input)
       {
           // Agent implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create Prompty Template:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: CustomAgent
   description: Custom agent for specific domain
   system: |
     You are a custom agent...
   user: |
     Process: {{input}}
   ```

3. **Integrate into Workflow:**
   ```csharp
   var customStep = processBuilder.AddStepFromType<CustomAgentStep>();
   // Add to orchestration flow
   ```

### Modifying Agent Behavior

**Hot-swap agent behavior** by updating Prompty templates:

```yaml
# Update orchestrator-agent.prompty
system: |
  You are the primary orchestrator with NEW BEHAVIOR...
  **New Decision Framework**:
  - Complex goals → NEW APPROACH
```

The system will use the updated behavior immediately without code changes.

### Adding New Skills

The system can **generate new skills dynamically** through the MakerAgent:

1. **Skill Generation Request:** MakerAgent identifies missing capability
2. **Code Generation:** Uses LLM to generate C# skill code
3. **Compilation:** Roslyn compiles code in-memory
4. **Integration:** New skill becomes immediately available
5. **Validation:** CheckerAgent validates the new skill
6. **Learning:** ReflectorAgent learns from the generation process

## 🔒 Security and Governance

- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error capture and reporting
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time workflow progress monitoring

### Custom Monitoring

```csharp
// Add custom monitoring
kernel.FunctionInvocationFilters.Add(new CustomMonitoringFilter());
```

## 🔄 The Strange Loop in Action

The system demonstrates the **Strange Loop principle** through:

1. **Self-Reference:** The system can improve its own orchestration logic
2. **Recursive Improvement:** Each cycle makes the system better
3. **Meta-Programming:** System generates its own capabilities
4. **Continuous Evolution:** No static state - always improving

### Example Strange Loop Cycle

1. **Goal:** "Improve system performance"
2. **Orchestrator:** Analyzes current performance bottlenecks
3. **Planner:** Creates plan to optimize slow components
4. **Maker:** Generates performance optimization skills
5. **Checker:** Validates performance improvements
6. **Reflector:** Learns which optimizations work best
7. **Result:** System is now faster and smarter
8. **Next Cycle:** System can now tackle more complex goals

## 🎯 Use Cases and Applications
