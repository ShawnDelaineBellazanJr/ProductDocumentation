# System Overview

Welcome to the Meta-Programmable Self-Evolving System documentation.

This system is an enterprise-grade, AI-driven platform designed to continuously adapt, extend, and improve itself in production. It leverages:

- **.NET 9 & Aspire 9.3** for robust, cloud-native hosting and configuration
- **Semantic Kernel 1.57** for multi-agent orchestration and LLM integration
- **Roslyn** for runtime C# code/plugin generation
- **OpenAPI/NSwag** for dynamic API creation
- **Prompty** for declarative, template-driven agent behavior
- **Entity Framework Core/PostgreSQL** for persistent state and knowledge
- **OpenTelemetry** for observability and monitoring

## Key Features
- Modular, clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Multi-agent orchestration (Planner, Maker, Checker, Reflector, Orchestrator, etc.)
- Runtime skill/plugin loading and dynamic API exposure
- Declarative, template-driven workflows and agent logic
- Persistent memory, audit trails, and self-improvement cycles
- Enterprise security, scalability, and monitoring
