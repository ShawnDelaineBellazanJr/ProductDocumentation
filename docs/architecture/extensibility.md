# Extensibility

The system is designed for runtime extensibility, allowing new capabilities to be added, updated, or removed without redeployment. This enables rapid innovation, continuous improvement, and seamless adaptation to new requirements in production environments.

## Dynamic Skill/Plugin Loading
- **Roslyn-based runtime compilation** enables the system (or agents) to generate and load new C# skills/plugins on the fly.
- Skills are registered with the Semantic Kernel and become immediately available to agents for function calling and orchestration.
- All dynamic plugins are persisted in the database for audit, traceability, and reload on restart.
- **Security:** Dynamic code is validated and sandboxed before loading. Approval workflows and audit logs ensure safe operation.
- **Self-Evolution:** Meta-agents (e.g., Reflector) can propose or generate new plugins in response to observed gaps or optimization opportunities.

## Dynamic API Generation
- **OpenAPI/NSwag integration** allows agents to define new API endpoints at runtime, based on evolving business needs or user requests.
- The system generates controllers from OpenAPI specs, compiles them with Roslyn, and registers them with ASP.NET Core routingâ€”no redeployment required.
- New endpoints are documented in Swagger UI and can be exposed internally or externally as needed, with full authentication and authorization support.
- **Use Case:** The system can expose a new skill as a REST endpoint within minutes of its creation, enabling rapid integration with other systems.

## Template-Driven Behavior
- **Prompty templates** define agent behavior, workflows, and policies in YAML/Markdown, decoupling logic from code.
- Templates can be updated at runtime by meta-agents (Reflector) or administrators, enabling prompt evolution and rapid adaptation to new requirements or lessons learned.
- **Declarative Orchestration:** Agents follow plans and policies described in templates, supporting chain-of-thought reasoning and dynamic workflows.

## Plugin/Skill Registry
- All skills (static and dynamic) are tracked in a registry table in the database, including metadata, source code, and version history.
- Agents can query the registry to discover available tools and capabilities, supporting self-discovery and dynamic planning.
- **Audit & Compliance:** The registry provides a full audit trail of all skills/plugins, including who/what created or modified them and when.

## External Integrations
- The plugin system supports integration with external APIs, databases, ML models, and automation tools (e.g., Playwright for browser automation, ML.NET for predictions, Microsoft 365 for enterprise workflows).
- New integrations can be added as plugins and made available to agents declaratively, without code changes to the core system.
- **Federation:** The architecture supports federated plugins/skills, enabling cross-system orchestration and LLM federation if needed.

## Best Practices
- **Versioning:** Always version dynamic plugins, templates, and APIs for traceability and rollback.
- **Testing:** Use automated and agent-driven tests for new plugins and endpoints before exposing them in production.
- **Approval Workflows:** Require human or meta-agent approval for high-impact changes in sensitive environments.
- **Documentation:** Document all new plugins, APIs, and templates in the registry and reference docs for discoverability.
