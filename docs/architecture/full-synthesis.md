# Meta-Programmable Self-Evolving System: Full Documentation Synthesis

---

## 1. System Foundation & Clean Architecture

- **Clean Architecture** underpins the system, enforcing strict separation of concerns:
  - **Domain Layer:** Core business models, logic, and interfaces (pure, no dependencies).
  - **Application Layer:** Orchestrates workflows and agent coordination, using only domain abstractions.
  - **Infrastructure Layer:** Implements data access, integrations, dynamic plugin loading (via Roslyn, NSwag), and is injected via DI.
  - **Interface Layer:** Exposes REST APIs/UI, delegates to application layer, supports dynamic endpoint registration.

- **Generic patterns** (repositories, services) and dependency inversion maximize testability and extensibility.

---

## 2. Agent Model & Declarative Orchestration

- **Agents** are intelligent actors, each with a specialized role and a declarative prompt template (Prompty):
  - **OrchestratorAgent:** Main coordinator, receives goals, delegates, manages context, closes the loop.
  - **PlannerAgent:** Decomposes goals into actionable plans.
  - **MakerAgent:** Executes plan steps, invokes skills/plugins.
  - **CheckerAgent:** Validates outputs, ensures quality and compliance.
  - **ReflectorAgent:** Analyzes outcomes, suggests improvements, updates prompts/plans.
  - **Meta-Agents:** (e.g., LearningAgent) can retrain models, update embeddings, or optimize system behavior.

- **Prompty Templates** (YAML/Markdown) define agent behavior, workflows, and policies in natural language, using Liquid/Handlebars syntax for dynamic context injection. These templates are versioned, auditable, and can be updated at runtime.

---

## 3. Extensibility: Plugins, Skills, and Dynamic APIs

- **Plugin System** supports:
  - **Code-based plugins (DLLs):** C# skills compiled and loaded at runtime (via Roslyn).
  - **Template-driven plugins:** Prompty files for agent logic, swappable and versioned.
  - **Registry:** All plugins are tracked with metadata, version, and audit history.

- **Dynamic API Generation:**
  - Agents/users provide OpenAPI specs.
  - NSwag generates C# controller code.
  - Roslyn compiles code in-memory.
  - New controllers/endpoints are registered with ASP.NET Core at runtime, instantly available and documented in Swagger UI.
  - All dynamic APIs are authenticated, authorized, and logged.

---

## 4. Self-Evolution & Continuous Improvement

- **Strange Loop Principle:** The system operates in a recursive loop:
  1. **Goal/Intent Received**
  2. **Orchestration & Planning**
  3. **Execution**
  4. **Validation**
  5. **Reflection & Learning**
  6. **Meta-Programming & Evolution**
  7. **Persistence & Audit**
  - This loop applies to all levels: skills, workflows, even the architecture itself.

- **Feedback Loop:** Central to continuous improvement:
  - Agents and users provide feedback (explicit or implicit).
  - Meta-agents analyze feedback, logs, and outcomes.
  - Improvements are planned and implemented in the next cycle.
  - All actions are logged and auditable.

- **Self-Evolution Mechanisms:**
  - Update prompt templates or agent instructions.
  - Generate/load new skills/plugins at runtime.
  - Expose new APIs or workflows dynamically.
  - Adjust configuration, thresholds, or policies.
  - All changes are tracked, versioned, and can require approval for high-impact updates.

## 5. Operational Excellence: Scaling, Deployment, and Governance

- **Scaling:**
  - **Horizontal:** Stateless API layer, distributed agent orchestration (queues), dynamic plugin loading from shared storage.
  - **Vertical:** Resource allocation for heavy LLM inference or plugin compilation.
  - **Cloud-Native:** Kubernetes deployment, Helm/IaC, HPA, service mesh, OpenTelemetry for observability.
  - **Distributed State:** Managed databases, Redis for fast context, global load balancing, agent federation for multi-region.

- **Security & Governance:**
  - All endpoints require Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication.
  - Audit logging for every agent action, code generation, and API creation.
  - Roslyn runs in a restricted AppDomain; CheckerAgent and SecurityValidationStep scan for forbidden patterns.
  - Rollback/versioning for all prompt and skill changes.
  - Approval workflows for sensitive changes; human-in-the-loop supported.

- **CI/CD & Deployment:**
  - Aspire 9.3 for configuration and DI.
  - Docker/Kubernetes manifests for deployment.
  - GitHub Actions for build, test, publish, and deploy.
  - Rolling upgrades, health checks, and monitoring best practices.

## 6. How-To, Reference, and Contribution

- **How-To Guides:** Step-by-step instructions for adding skills, agents, dynamic plugins, OpenAPI endpoints, and monitoring.
- **Reference:** API reference, database schema, configuration, security, telemetry.
- **Contributing:** Guidelines, code style, pull request process, changelog.

## 7. Example End-to-End Flow

1. **User submits a goal** (e.g., "Onboard developer Alice").
2. **OrchestratorAgent** logs and routes to PlannerAgent.
3. **PlannerAgent** decomposes into tasks (create AD user, assign permissions, provision environment, send docs).
4. **MakerAgent** uses skills for each task, requests new skills if needed (via Roslyn).
5. **CheckerAgent** validates all steps, runs integration tests.
6. **ReflectorAgent** analyzes, logs lessons, and suggests improvements.
7. **Loop continues** if improvements or retries are needed; otherwise, process is marked complete.

## 8. Best Practices & Patterns

- **Keep domain logic pure and free of infrastructure concerns.**
- **Use generic patterns and dependency injection for flexibility.**
- **Version and audit all templates, plugins, and APIs.**
- **Automate feedback analysis, but support human review for critical changes.**
- **Test all plugins and templates in staging before production.**
- **Monitor, alert, and scale using cloud-native tools.**

## 9. Key Diagrams & Data Flows

- **High-Level System:** User/API → Interface → Orchestration → Domain → Plugin System → Semantic Kernel → Dynamic API/Swagger.
- **Agent Orchestration:** Orchestrator manages Planner, Maker, Checker, Reflector; PMCR loop is central.
- **Plugin/API Loading:** Agents generate code → Roslyn compiles → Skill registry → Semantic Kernel → API exposure.
- **Scaling:** API nodes behind load balancer, agent tasks via distributed queue, shared database/cache.
