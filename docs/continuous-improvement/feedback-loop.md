# Feedback Loop

The feedback loop is central to the systemâ€™s ability to continuously improve, adapt, and self-optimize. It enables agents and users to provide feedback, which is then incorporated into future actions, workflows, and even system logic.

## How the Feedback Loop Works

1. **Observation & Monitoring**
   - Agents and monitoring tools observe system outputs, user interactions, and performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rates, user satisfaction).
   - All relevant data is logged and made available for analysis.

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Feedback can be explicit (user suggestions, corrections, ratings) or implicit (detected errors, performance anomalies, agent self-assessment).
   - Feedback events (e.g., `documentation_feedback_received`) are emitted and captured by the orchestration layer.

3. **Analysis & Reflection**
   - Meta-agents (e.g., ReflectorAgent, CheckerAgent) analyze feedback, logs, and outcomes.
   - They identify patterns, root causes, and opportunities for improvement.
   - Automated and human-in-the-loop reviews are supported.

4. **Planning & Adaptation**
   - The PlannerAgent or OrchestratorAgent incorporates feedback into new plans, workflows, or prompt templates.
   - If needed, new skills/plugins are generated or existing ones are refined.
   - The system can update configuration, thresholds, or even agent instructions based on feedback.

5. **Iteration**
   - The improved plan or logic is executed in the next cycle.
   - The loop continues, enabling continuous learning and adaptation.

## Example: Documentation Feedback Loop
- User reviews generated documentation and submits suggestions.
- A `documentation_feedback_received` event is triggered.
- The GenerateDocumentationAgent incorporates feedback and rewrites the documentation.
- The process repeats until the documentation meets requirements.

## Monitoring & Metrics
- OpenTelemetry and Aspire are used to collect metrics and traces.
- Dashboards and alerts help detect issues and track improvement over time.
- Feedback and improvement actions are logged for audit and compliance.

## Best Practices
- Encourage frequent, actionable feedback from users and agents.
- Automate feedback analysis where possible, but support human review for critical changes.
- Track the impact of improvements to validate effectiveness.
- Maintain an audit trail of feedback, actions taken, and outcomes.
