# Self-Evolution

Self-evolution is the system’s ability to autonomously adapt, optimize, and extend itself over time—without manual intervention. This is achieved through agent-driven feedback loops, meta-agents, and dynamic extensibility.

## What is Self-Evolution?
- The system continuously monitors its own performance, user feedback, and environment.
- When gaps, inefficiencies, or new requirements are detected, the system can:
  - Update prompt templates or agent instructions
  - Generate and load new skills/plugins at runtime
  - Expose new APIs or workflows dynamically
  - Adjust configuration, thresholds, or policies
- All changes are tracked, versioned, and auditable.

## Mechanisms of Self-Evolution

### 1. Feedback-Driven Adaptation
- User and agent feedback is analyzed by meta-agents (Reflector, Checker)
- Improvements are planned and implemented in the next iteration

### 2. Dynamic Skill/Plugin Generation
- Agents can generate new C# code (skills/plugins) using LLMs
- Code is validated, compiled (Roslyn), and loaded at runtime
- New capabilities become immediately available

### 3. Prompt and Workflow Evolution
- Prompt templates are updated based on lessons learned
- Workflows can be restructured or optimized by meta-agents
- Declarative templates make changes safe and transparent

### 4. Continuous Learning
- The system can retrain ML models or update knowledge bases as new data arrives
- Embeddings and semantic memory evolve with usage

## Example: Self-Evolving Documentation Process
1. User submits feedback on generated documentation
2. ReflectorAgent updates the documentation prompt template
3. GenerateDocumentationAgent produces improved docs in the next cycle
4. The process repeats, with each iteration building on prior improvements

## Governance & Safety
- All self-evolution actions are logged and require approval for high-impact changes
- Rollback and versioning mechanisms ensure stability
- Human-in-the-loop is supported for critical updates

## Best Practices
- Monitor the impact of self-evolution to ensure positive outcomes
- Use version control and audit trails for all changes
- Balance automation with oversight for sensitive domains
